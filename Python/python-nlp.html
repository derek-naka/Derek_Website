          Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer
          science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence
          or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text
          and spoken words in much the same way human beings can. For each of
          the following functions, all of the code and datasets can be found
          here:

        <p class="paragraph">
          We will be analysing the following data about housing descriptions on
          Zillow. Note that the data must contain words and preferably
          sentences.

        />
        <p class="paragraph">
          Based on of this dataset, we can take a few initial text statistics
          including the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="paragraph">
          <li>
            Sentence Count: The number of sentences in the paragraph/description
          </li>
          <li>
            Reading Time: The approximate amount of time required to read the
            paragraph based on length and complexity of sentences
          </li>
          <li>
            Grade Level: the minimum grade level required to read the paragraph
            and fully understand it based on vocabulary and sentence structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reading Ease: how hard the passage is to read based on length of
            sentences and number of syllables per word. A score of 100 means
            your copy is very easy to read. And, a score of 0 means your text is
            very difficult to read.
          </li>

        <h2 class="subtitles">Word Vectorization</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Converting words to vectors, or word vectorization, is a natural
          language processing (NLP) process. The process uses language models to
          map words into vector space. A vector space represents each word by a
          vector of real numbers. It also allows words with similar meanings
          have similar representations. The first step in this is to get rid of
          all of the "stop" word or words that don't have much meaning such as
          "a", "the", "and", etc. which is represented by the code below:
        </p>
        <img
          class="nlp-img"
          src="python_images/python-nlp2.png"
          alt="An image of data"
        />
        <p class="paragraph">
          After removing all of the stop words, we can perform the word
          vectorization, then reduce it to 3 dimensions using a Principle
          Component Analysis algorithm. This will make it easier to represent on
          a graph to see which houses have similar description as compared to a
          vector with over 10 dimensions.

          alt="An image of data"
        />
        <p class="paragraph">
          And with this, this is what the final dataset should look like with
          new variables all about the description of the home.
