        <h2 class="subtitles">Scatterplots</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          A scatter plot is a type of plot or mathematical diagram using
          Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables
          for a set of data. Note that both of the variables need to be
          quantitative variables for the plot to work. Below is an example of a
          scatterplot using the following data set & code:
        </p>
        <img
          class="data-img"
          src="python_images/python-data-flower.png"
          alt="An image of data"
        />
        <img
          class="data-img"
          src="python_images/python-scatter.png"
          alt="An image of data"
        />
        <h2 class="subtitles">Boxplot</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Boxplots are standardized ways of displaying the distribution of data
          based on a five number summary (minimum, first quartile [Q1], median,
          third quartile [Q3] and maximum). It can tell you about your outliers
          and what their values are. Note that the data must be quantitative.
          Below is an example of a boxplot using the following data set & code:
        </p>
        <img
          class="data-img"
          src="python_images/python-data-flower.png"
          alt="An image of data"
        />
        <img
          class="data-img"
          src="python_images/python-boxplot.png"
          alt="An image of data"
        />
        <h2 class="subtitles">Pie Chart</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic which is divided into
          slices to illustrate numerical proportion. In a pie chart, the arc
          length of each slice is proportional to the quantity it represents.
          Note that the data must have one categorical variable paired with the
          quantity. Below is an example of a pie chart using the following data
          set & code:
        </p>
        <img
          class="data-img"
          src="python_images/python-data-flower.png"
          alt="An image of data"
        />
        <img
          class="data-img"
          src="python_images/python-pie.png"
          alt="An image of data"
        />
        <h2 class="subtitles">Bar Graph</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          A bar chart or bar graph is a chart or graph that presents categorical
          data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the
          values that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or
          horizontally. Note that the data must have one categorical variable
          paired with the quantity. Below is an example of a bar graph using the
          following data set & code:
        </p>
        <img
          class="data-img"
          src="python_images/python-data-flower.png"
          alt="An image of data"
        />
        <img
          class="data-img"
          src="python_images/python-bar.png"
          alt="An image of data"
        />
        <h2 class="subtitles">Histogram</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          A histogram is a graph used to represent the frequency distribution of
          a few data points of one variable. Histograms often classify data into
          various “bins” or “range groups” and count how many data points belong
          to each of those bins. Note that the data must be quantitative. Below
          is an example of a histogram using the following data set & code:
        </p>
        <img
          class="data-img"
          src="python_images/python-data-flower.png"
          alt="An image of data"
        />
        <img
          class="data-img"
          src="python_images/python-histogram.png"
          alt="An image of data"
        />
        <h2 class="subtitles">Side-by-Side Bar Graph</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          As a variation of a bar chart, a side-by-side bar chart is similar to
          a stacked bar chart, except it puts bars side by side instead of
          stacking them. The side-by-side bar charts add a second dimension
          based on a standard bar chart, allowing for easier comparison between
          groups. Note that the data must be quantitative. Below is an example
          of a boxplot using the following data set & code:
        </p>
        <img
          class="data-img"
          src="python_images/python-data-housing.png"
          alt="An image of data"
        />
        <img
          class="data-img"
          src="python_images/python-side-by-side.png"
          alt="An image of data"
        />
        <h2 class="subtitles">Customization</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Matplotlib allows for some customization as listed as below. In
          addition, there is an example using some of the customizations.
        </p>
