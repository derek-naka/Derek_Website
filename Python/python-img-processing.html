          Image processing is the process of transforming an image into a
          digital form and performing certain operations to get some useful
          information from it. For each of the following functions, all of the
          code and datasets can be found here:

          For this section, we are going to use the following image along with
          PyTesseract to extract text from the image. For this project, you need
          to download pytesseract and route where you downloaded PyTesseract to
          the command as seen in the first image at the bottom. From there,
          follow the code below to run PyTesseract on the image and see what the
          initial output will be. I chose this image since there is some cursive
          and other fancy writing that it will not be able to pick up unless
          there is more image pre-processing that is done.

            Resizing the image will allow for PyTesseract to better read the
            image provided as the text will be larger and easier for the model
            to read as compared to a smaller image. In order to do this, follow
            the code below:

          <p class="paragraph">
            It helps in simplifying algorithms and as well eliminates the
            complexities related to computational requirements. It makes room
            for easier learning for those who are new to image processing. This
            is because grayscale compressors an image to its barest minimum
            pixel. In order to do this, follow the code below:

        <div class="img-processing-box">
          <p class="paragraph">
            Histogram equalization is a process where the intensity values of an
            image are adjusted to create a higher overall contrast. Digital
            Image Processing is a significant aspect of data science. It is used
            to enhance and modify images so that their attributes are more
            easily understandable. In order to do this, follow the code below:

        <div class="img-processing-box">
          <p class="paragraph">
            A bilateral filter is used for smoothening images and reducing
            noise, while preserving edges. This allows us to ignore small
            imperfections in the image and make sure that it isn't converted
            into text. In order to do this, follow the code below:

        <div class="img-processing-box">
          <p class="paragraph">
            Images also need to be converted into binary in order for a computer
            to process them so that they can be seen on our screen. The main
            advantage of binary images is that it decreases computational load
            and increases efficiency of the systems. In order to do this, follow
            the code below:

        <div class="img-processing-box">
          <p class="paragraph">
            Dilation of an image is the process by which the object area in the
            image is increased. This process is used to accentuate features in
            the image (in this case the text). It increases the white region in
            the image or the size of the foreground object increases. In order
            to do this, follow the code below:
          </p>

        <div class="img-processing-box">
          <p class="paragraph">
            Erosion removes pixels on object boundaries. In other words, it
            shrinks the foreground objects. Enlarge foreground holes. Like in
            Image Processing Kernels, a larger size of the Structure Element,
            the effect of Erosion increase. In order to do this, follow the code
            below:

        <h2 class="subtitles">NOTE</h2>
        <p class="NOTE white">
          Note that when reading text off of images, it is a mix of these image
          pre-processing techniques that are required to get the most accurate
          reading possible. HOWEVER, it is not necessary to use all of them, as
          seen in the example above. The most accurate reading of the image was
          after the histogram equalization which shows that not all of the image
          processing techniques were even helpful, so keep that in mind when
          using these functions.
