          Supervised machine learning is a subcategory of machine learning and
          artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets
          to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes
          accurately.For each of the following machine learning models, all of
          the code and datasets can be found here:

        <h2 class="subtitles">Linear Regression</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Linear regression is a type of statistical analysis used to predict
          the relationship between two variables. It assumes a linear
          relationship between the independent variable and the dependent
          variable, and aims to find the best-fitting line that describes the
          relationship. Note that the data must be quantitative. Below is an
          example of linear regression using the following data set & code:

        <h2 class="subtitles">Multiple Linear Regression</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Multiple linear regression refers to a statistical technique that uses
          two or more independent variables to predict the outcome of a
          dependent variable. The technique enables analysts to determine the
          variation of the model and the relative contribution of each
          independent variable in the total variance. Note that the data must be
          quantitative. Below is an example of multiple linear regression using
          the following data set & code:

        <div class="border-machine-learning">

        <h2 class="subtitles">Non-Linear Regression</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Nonlinear regression is a statistical technique that helps describe
          nonlinear relationships in experimental data. Nonlinear regression
          models are generally assumed to be parametric, where the model is
          described as a nonlinear equation. Note that the data must be
          quantitative. Below is an example of non-linear regression using the
          following data set & code:
