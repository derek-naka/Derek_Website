                When placing your house for sale on Zillow or any other website,
                there are many things that are set values such as number of
                rooms, square feet, etc. However, the few things that can be
                changed are the selling price and description of the home. For
                this project, we were tasked with determining to what extent
                does the home description have on the house's performance on the
                market.

                </button>
              </a>
              <p class="gray">
                Since 1959, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame has
                honored and celebrated some of the game’s greatest moments and
                brightest stars. To be nominated and selected to be in the Hall
                of Fame is not only a huge honor for the player, but also a sign
                to know that they were one of the best players to ever play
                basketball. Many of these players were role models,
                inspirations, and key figures in the NBA that shaped how the
                game is played today. Less than 5% of the players to ever play
                in the NBA ever get nominated, and even less get selected to be
                part of this elite group. With this in mind, what does it take
                in order to be a part of the Hall of Fame? What made each one of
                these players stand heads above the rest? Throughout this
                article we are going to explore what is necessary to be known as
                one of the best players in NBA history and to be selected to be
                a part of the Hall of Fame.

                  Transfer Market Effect on Team Success in Premier League
                </button>
              </a>
              <p class="gray">
                Often referred to as the most competitive league in world
                soccer, the English Premier League is home to many of soccer’s
                best teams. Many of these teams have experienced great successes
                over the years and are now massively successful businesses,
                earning hundreds of millions of dollars every year. Success for
                these teams, however, is often extremely expensive. Along with
                the many costs associated with running the teams successfully,
                these teams often spend massive amounts of money on the players
                that compete for their team. The transfer market is a market in
                world soccer where teams can pay each other in exchange for
                players. This market has become increasingly expensive, and many
                Premier League teams have become extremely involved, often
                spending millions of dollars every year on players. But is this
                spending worth it?

                  Impact of Soccer Managers on their Teams
                </button>
              </a>
              <p class="gray">
                There have been many great soccer players throughout history
                including Ronaldo, Messi, Maradona, Pele, and the list goes on.
                But what many fans don’t realize is how important managers are
                to these winning teams. The manager’s role is to sign new
                players, coach the practices, create team formations, sub
                players in and out of the game, and select the players who are
                going to play the game. However, many fans of the sport
                sometimes don’t believe that the manager has that big of a role
                in the team. For this article, we are going to look at one of
                the best managers in history, Jose Mourinho, and see how much of
                an impact he has made on the teams he has coached by comparing
                him to the previous and subsequent managers of those teams. We
                chose him because he has coached seven teams over the course of
                over 20 years and is known for being one of the best to do it.
                Throughout this article, we are going to explore how much of a
                difference managers can make on a team and if it is their great
                coaching that makes a team or if it is the players themselves
                that make the difference.
