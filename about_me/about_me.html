            Hi, I am Derek Nakagawa, a current 3rd year student at UCLA studying
            Data Theory. Over the past few years, I have been honing my data
            science skills through some clubs at UCLA (Bruin Sports Analytics &
            DataRes) and individual projects. For both of these clubs, I hold
            leadership positions so I can not only work on my technical skills
            in the feild, but also develop some leadership skills as well.
            During my time at UCLA, I have worked on projects that required
            visualizations, supervised machine learning (linear & non-linear
            regression), unsupervised machine learning (k-means clustering),
            natural language processing, image processing (OCR Model), and many
            more data visualization techniques. I will continue to learn more
            and more data science techniques and share my skills through this
            website.
