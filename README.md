# Derek_Website

Created a website from scratch using HTML & CSS. This has a combination of teaching R & Python and my projects that I have worked on throughout college. It has 4 pages of now: about me, learning python, learning R, and projects. 

This will be continued to be updated as I learn more coding functions & work on more projects.
